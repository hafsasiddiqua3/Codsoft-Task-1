# Codsoft-Task-1
The Python script is a minimal command-line To-Do List application. It uses a JSON file ('tasks.json') to store tasks. Users can add tasks with timestamps, remove tasks by index, and view the current task list. The main loop offers options to add tasks, remove tasks, or exit. Task data includes titles and timestamps.
